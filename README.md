## Towards Next-Generation Solar-to-Hydrogen Production

---

## Scientific Motivation
The large-scale deployment of renewable hydrogen is currently limited by
the efficiency, stability, and scalability of existing production
technologies. In particular, **high-temperature solar-driven routes**
offer a unique opportunity to overcome thermodynamic and kinetic
limitations, yet remain far from technological maturity.

My research vision is to establish **a new class of integrated
solar-to-hydrogen platforms**, combining thermochemical and
electrochemical approaches under extreme operating conditions.

## Core Vision
I aim to develop **efficient, stable, and scalable hydrogen production
technologies** based on **ceria-driven redox cycles** and
**high-temperature electrochemical systems**, moving beyond incremental
materials optimisation towards **system-level breakthroughs**.

The central hypothesis is that **electrical assistance, data-driven
materials design, and accelerated experimentation** can unlock
previously inaccessible efficiency regimes in solar fuel production.

## Strategic Research Pillars

### 1. Advanced Redox Materials Beyond Incremental Design
- Design of ceria-based and non-stoichiometric oxides with enhanced
  redox capacity and long-term stability
- Integration of defect chemistry, microstructure control, and
  operando characterisation

### 2. Electrically Assisted Thermochemical Cycles
- Hybridisation of thermochemical cycles with controlled electrical
  input to overcome kinetic and thermodynamic bottlenecks
- Development of reactor concepts enabling dynamic operation

### 3. High-Temperature Electrochemical Systems (HT-SOEC)
- Fundamental understanding of degradation mechanisms
- Coupling materials discovery with realistic operating conditions

### 4. AI-Guided Discovery and Accelerated Validation
- Integration of modelling, machine learning, and experimental feedback
- Transition from intuition-driven to data-driven research loops

## Methodological Approach
My research strategy explicitly combines:
- **Fundamental understanding** (materials chemistry and thermodynamics)
- **Multiscale modelling**
- **Experimental validation under relevant conditions**
- **System integration and scalability assessment**

This approach ensures scientific depth while maintaining technological
relevance.

## Long-Term Objective
My long-term objective is to consolidate an **internationally competitive
research group** at the intersection of **solar energy, electrochemistry,
and materials science**, capable of leading large-scale European
projects and translating fundamental advances into deployable
technologies.
