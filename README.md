🌍 The Energy Challenge

Renewable hydrogen at scale is limited not by materials alone,
but by the lack of integrated, high-efficiency systems operating
under realistic conditions.

**High-temperature solar routes** offer a unique opportunity to overcome
thermodynamic and kinetic barriers — if materials, devices and systems
are co-designed.

🧭 Core Vision 

My vision is to enable **high-efficiency solar-to-hydrogen energy
conversion** through the development of **integrated high-temperature
platforms**, where materials, electrochemical devices, and system
operation are co-designed.

Rather than optimising isolated components, my research targets
**system-level performance**, explicitly addressing efficiency,
stability, dynamic operation, and scalability under realistic
conditions.

🎯 From materials → to devices → to energy systems
I aim to develop **efficient, stable, and scalable hydrogen production
technologies** based on **metal-oxide redox cycles** and
**high-temperature electrochemical systems**, moving beyond incremental
materials optimisation towards **system-level breakthroughs**.

The central hypothesis is that **electrical assistance, data-driven
materials design, and accelerated experimentation** can unlock
previously inaccessible efficiency regimes in solar fuel production.
